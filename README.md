In this SQL project, I tackled a series of complex database queries to extract valuable insights and solve various challenges. Here's a breakdown of the tasks I successfully accomplished:

Data Formatting and Extraction: I formatted the "book_date" column in the Bookings table to display dates in "yyyy-mmm-dd" format, ensuring readability and consistency.

Column Selection: I retrieved specific columns from a dataset in the exact sequence required, demonstrating proficiency in data retrieval and manipulation.

Analysis of Seat Allocation: By writing a query to find the least allocated seat among all seats, I provided insights into seat distribution patterns within the dataset.

Monthly Analysis of Passenger Payments: Leveraging database queries, I identified the highest and least paying passengers on a month-wise basis, aiding in revenue analysis and customer segmentation.

Flight Details Analysis: I extracted travel details of flights with return journeys, identified flights without boarding passes, and determined the details of the longest and earliest morning flights, showcasing comprehensive analysis skills.

Airport and Flight Analysis: By querying airport and flight data, I determined airport codes in specific timezones, seat counts for various fare conditions, and the number of flights flying between specific locations or operated by particular aircraft manufacturers.

Cancellation and Delay Analysis: Using SQL queries, I identified flights that were cancelled or delayed, along with the corresponding aircraft and airports involved, facilitating operational analysis and decision-making.

Refund Calculation: I determined customers eligible for refunds due to flight cancellations and calculated the total refund amounts, demonstrating proficiency in financial analysis within the context of database management.

Overall, this project not only showcased my SQL skills in data querying and manipulation but also highlighted my ability to derive actionable insights from complex datasets.
